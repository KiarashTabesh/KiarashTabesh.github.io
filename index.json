The process of bone recovery is one of the issues to be addressed within a mechanical framework. In this study, a model for the bone healing process is proposed taking into account the bone cell population as well as the effect of energy dissipation. Numerical simulations for bone under a cyclic external loading are performed in order to show predicting capabilities of the model.","tags":[],"title":"A mathematical model for bone cell population dynamics of fracture healing considering the dissipation effect","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Finite element analysis and optimization of the structure of a machine tool\nIn this project, I analyzed the structural behavior of a machine tool system using the finite element method.

Our goal was to develop a concept to reduce the energy consumption of refrigerators. After we developed the conceptual design using the systematic methods, Professor Mario Guagliano supervised us to develop the detailed mechanical design.\nWe took advantage of Inventor to prepare the CAD model and the drawings, and Abaqus CAE for FEM assessments. After considering DOX, and performing different mechanical analysis using the finite element method, the project is now ready for prototyping. (in the picture you can see the snapfit mechanism that we used for the easier assembly).\nThis project was recognized as one of the best student projects by Rold company in Jan 2021, and the project got a full mark in the course of Advanced Mechanical Design.
