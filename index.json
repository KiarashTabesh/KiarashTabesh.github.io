The process of bone recovery is one of the issues to be addressed within a mechanical framework. In this study, a model for the bone healing process is proposed taking into account the bone cell population as well as the effect of energy dissipation. Numerical simulations for bone under a cyclic external loading are performed in order to show predicting capabilities of the model.

Our goal was to develop a concept to reduce the energy consumption of refrigerators. After we developed the conceptual design using the systematic methods, Professor Mario Guagliano supervised us to develop the detailed mechanical design.\nWe took advantage of Inventor to prepare the CAD model and the drawings, and Abaqus CAE for FEM assessments. After considering DOX, and performing different mechanical analysis using the finite element method, the project is now ready for prototyping. (in the picture you can see the snapfit mechanism that we used for the easier assembly).\nThis project was recognized as one of the best student projects by Rold company in Jan 2021, and the project got a full mark in the course of Advanced Mechanical Design. I would like to thank my colleagues for their great contribution and team-work: Alessandra Panerai, Edison Shehu, and Lorenzo Serventi.\nReport Content\n","date":1624147200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624147200,"objectID":"f424dda8892e5fb37601a9774fd20558","permalink":"https://KiarashTabesh.github.io/project/shelf/","publishdate":"2021-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/shelf/","section":"project","summary":"A collaborative study between Politecnico di Milano and [Rold](https://www.rold.com/) company","tags":["Advanced Mechanical Design","FEM"],"title":"Transparent roller panel for a refrigerator shelf","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"OTHER PROJECTS\n Conceptual design of a bioreactor Prototype development of smart homes Simulation and visualization of metal forming and forging processes using Abaqus Design and fabrication of a platform for Kuka Robot Development of an anti-shock structure for high-altitude free fall Programming PLC controller for hydraulic actuators Transmission system design: gears, shafts, bearings, chains, belts, clutch and break Development of a 4 DoF anthropomorphic robot, operating with Arduino Selection of the appropriate motor/gearbox for an upper-limb exoskeleton with rehabilitation application Simulation of a 3 DoF anthropomorphic manipulator with positioning or force-control in MATLAB Simulation and visualization of fluid flow around a cylinder using ANSYS-Fluent \u0026ldquo;Hive drone\u0026rdquo; startup: creating and scaling up  PRESENTATIONS\n FE nonlinear analysis of the mast of a forklif (see the presentation here) (Polimi, Italy, 2021) The effects of considering energy dissipation on bone remodeling process (M\u0026amp;MoCS, Italy, 2018) Applications of robots in manufacturing (IUT, Iran, 2017) Elastography techniques (IUT, Iran, 2016) Introduction to diamond’s structure and properties (IUT, Iran, 2015)  Projects are available in my LinkedIn page\n","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"0c125f3b4eb7e2a0f34cbc0e8ab24b54","permalink":"https://KiarashTabesh.github.io/project/zz_other-projects/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/zz_other-projects/","section":"project","summary":"12 Other Projects and 5 Presentations","tags":["Demo"],"title":"Other Projects","type":"project"},{"authors":["Kiarash Tabesh","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
