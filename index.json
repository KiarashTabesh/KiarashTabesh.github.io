The process of bone recovery is one of the issues to be addressed within a mechanical framework. In this study, a model for the bone healing process is proposed taking into account the bone cell population as well as the effect of energy dissipation. Numerical simulations for bone under a cyclic external loading are performed in order to show predicting capabilities of the model.","tags":[],"title":"A mathematical model for bone cell population dynamics of fracture healing considering the dissipation effect","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"FE analysis and optimization of the structure of a machine tool\nRead the report\n","date":1624147200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624147200,"objectID":"c22ac5446aa7b5b66ebe073d7cd52807","permalink":"https://KiarashTabesh.github.io/project/fem-machine-tool/","publishdate":"2021-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fem-machine-tool/","section":"project","summary":"FE analysis and optimization of the structure of a machine tool\nRead the report","tags":["FEM"],"title":"FE analysis and optimization of the structure of a machine tool","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"What we did in this project:\n Using systematic innovation methods and tools Patent search Design for Manufacturing Design for Assembly Design for Disassembly Design for Environment Design for Reliability Finite elements model Optimization of mechanical system Robust Design  This team-work project was started in Sep 2020 in the course of \u0026ldquo;Methods and Tools for Systematic Innovation\u0026rdquo; under the supervision of Professor Gaetano Cascini and the collaboration of Rold Company.
